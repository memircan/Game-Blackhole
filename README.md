# Blackhole
Game link: https://memircan.itch.io/blackhole

Hello.
It is my first game that I made to reinforce the knowledge I gained while learning Unity.</br> The aim of the game is based on progressing in an endless loop and making high scores.</br>
While developing the game, I used the "Singleton" and "Object Pool" design patterns for performance.
